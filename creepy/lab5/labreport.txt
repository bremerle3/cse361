Table 1. Valgrind Results.
Number of instructions executed:
			-O0		-O1		-02		-O3
compute_totals		7510		3209		3110		1307
compute_grades		6681		1200		1172		1172
compute_histogram	6654		2656		2555		2554
PROGRAM TOTALS		20845		7065		6837		5033

Question 1. Name one other thing besides instruction counts that
valgrind could tell you about your code (if you were to run it with
different flags):

Valgrind could also tell us about the cache miss rate of our program by using the cachegrind tool!

Table 2. Gprof Results.
Percentage of where your un-optimized code spends its time:
compute_totals	    	 11%
compute_grades		 16%
compute_histogram	 73%

Question 2. Which function will you improve and why?

Go improve your code.

Question 3. Describe your improvement in 1-2 sentences:

Table 3. Valgrind Results.
Number of instructions executed post programmer optimization:
       	  	       optimized
compute_totals	       
compute_grades	       
compute_histogram      
PROGRAM TOTALS

Table 4. Gprof Results.
Percentage of where your optimized code spends its time:
compute_totals	    	 16% 
compute_grades		 23%
compute_histogram	 61%

Question 4. Now which function would you try to improve and why?
